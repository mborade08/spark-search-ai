```

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **uv**: Python package manager - [Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- **Google Cloud SDK**: For GCP services - [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- **make**: Build automation tool - [Install](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (pre-installed on most Unix-based systems)


## Quick Start (Local Testing)

Install required packages and launch the local development environment:

```bash
make install && make playground
```

## Commands

| Command              | Description                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make install`       | Install all required dependencies using uv                                                  |
| `make playground`    | Launch local development environment with backend and frontend - leveraging `adk web` command.|
| `make backend`       | Deploy agent to Cloud Run (use `IAP=true` to enable Identity-Aware Proxy) |
| `make local-backend` | Launch local development server |
| `make test`          | Run unit and integration tests                                                              |
| `make lint`          | Run code quality checks (codespell, ruff, mypy)                                             |                        |
| `uv run jupyter lab` | Launch Jupyter notebook                                                                     |

## Usage

This template follows a "bring your own agent" approach - you focus on your business logic, and the template handles everything else (UI, infrastructure, deployment).

1. **Integrate:** Import your agent by adding your agent app folder containing the app code changes under the `apps` folder.
2. **Test:** Explore your agent functionality using the Streamlit playground with `make playground` and by deploying locally as a Fast API server using `make local-backend` command. The playground offers features like chat history, user feedback, and various input types, and automatically reloads your agent on code changes. You can use the 'adk_app_testing.ipynb' notebook to test your app.
3. **Deploy:** Once the agent app is tested locally, you need to push your app changes to the main branch by raising a pull request. Once the pull request is reviewed and merged, the app changes will get deployed automatically to the dev Cloud run service using Cloud Build.
4. **Monitor:** Track performance and gather insights using Cloud Logging and Tracing to iterate on your application.

The project includes a `GEMINI.md` file that provides context for AI tools like Gemini CLI when asking questions about your template.


## Deployment

### Local Environment

You can deploy your app locally using the following two options

1. **Using adk web:** You can deploy using adk web. Run the following `make playground` command which deploys the app using adk web. 

2. **Fast API server:** You can deploy the app locally as a Fast API server. Run the following `make local-backend` command to deploy the app locally as a Fast API server.


### Dev Environment

The app changes cannot be directly deployed to the dev environment. The app changes need to be pushed to the main branch by raising a pull request. Once the pull request is approved and the app changes are merged, those changes will get deployed automatically by the CI process using Cloud Build.
